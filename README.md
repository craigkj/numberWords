# Converting Numbers to Strings
We need a function that converts numeric values into their string representation. A simple example would be that the function returns the string `zero` when given the value 0.

Other examples include:

```
0: 'zero',
7: 'seven',
8: 'eight',
10: 'ten',
15: 'fifteen',
19: 'nineteen',
21: 'twenty one',
26: 'twenty six',
42: 'forty two',
73: 'seventy three',
106: 'one hundred and six',
233: 'two hundred and thirty three',
1356: 'one thousand and fifty six',
26784: 'twenty six thousand seven hundred and eighty four',
1356786: 'one million three hundred and fifty six thousand seven hundred and eighty six'
```

How you break the problem down and create a solution is up to you, but we're particularly interested in seeing:
* How you work with others.
* High quality, well structured, maintainable code.
* Test cases for your code.
